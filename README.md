# Components
## Viconia Romance Expanded
Allows an alternate romance path for a female CHARNAME and allows romance for CHARNAMEs of all races. A few select dialogues have been expanded.

<details><summary><b>Features</b></summary>
<ul>
  <li>F/F Romance that does not require sexual acts, making it ace-friendly.</li>
  <li>New romance conflicts and interjections for Anomen, Rasaad, and Hexxat.</li>
  <li>Improved and expanded dialogue for both genders.</li>
    <ul><li>LT7: Viconia’s compliment is reflective of CHARNAME’s stats.</li>
    <li>LT9: Viconia's dialogue will change to reflect if she actually told the story about the farmer.</li>
    <li>LT13: The events of SOD are acknowledged. The player may also have a more personalized discussion of how Viconia views CHARNAME’s race. Relatedly, LT31 has Viconia say she "likely" worshipped Lolth longer than CHARNAME has been alive in order to account for longer-lived races.</li>
    <li>LT33: The dialogue option stating that Viconia mentioned her brother will only appear if she actually mentioned her brother.</li>
    <li>LT37: Dialogue referencing Viconia's story about the baby will change to reflect if she actually told the story.</li>
    <li>LT55: CHARNAME can share more specific coming-of-age moments with Viconia. Imoen may interject if present.</li>
    <li>LT57: Viconia’s dialogue will reflect the current state of the plot, including whether or not Imoen has been rescued and if Bodhi is still alive. Imoen may interject if present.</li>
    <li>LT59: When discussing the future, the player can now bring up their stronghold (if any) and Viconia will react accordingly.</li>
    <li>Romance support for all races.</li>
    <ul><li>Half-elves may ask Viconia to use less racist language when refering to half-elves in general.</li>
    <li>Elves will get a special dialogue with Viconia upon entering Suldanessellar.</li></ul></ul>
  <li>A few minor grammar, spelling, and miscellaneous corrections.</li>
</ul></details>

<details><summary><b>Existing Patches</b></summary>
 The following mods have had patches built into the Viconia component of Romance Expanded. To take advantage of these patches, install Romance Expanded <i>after</i> the mods listed below.
 <ul><li><a href="https://downloads.weaselmods.net/download/will-of-the-wisps/">Will of the Wisps</a>: Shaman stronghold can be discussed in LT59.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.pocketplane.net/unfinished-business/">Unfinished Business</a>: If using the Pai'na component, Viconia may address Pai'na more politely.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/555-viconia-friendship/">Viconia Friendship</a>: Viconia's friendship path will no longer start during an F/F romance. It will instead start after a breakup, as intended. This prevents duplicate dialogues from triggering.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/530-iep-extended-banters/">IEP Extended Banters</a>: The Korgan-Viconia banter now reflects whether Viconia is in a relationship with a female character. Two Jaheira-Viconia banters may change if Viconia has promised to be more respectful of half-elves.</li>
 </ul></ul></details>

<details><summary><b>Known Issues</b></summary>
In the unmodded romance, there are a couple of issues with LTs triggering correctly. LT41 and LT51 will not always immediately trigger after their previous lovetalks despite being intended to do so. Relatedly, LT67 will immediately trigger after LT65 despite being meant to trigger after some time has passed. These issues persist in the modded version. A solution is being sought and will hopefully be implemented in future versions of the mod.<p>

If you encounter any additional issues--especially lines that refer to a female CHARNAME as male--please let me know on one of the discussion forums.</details>

### Alternate Audio (Viconia)
This option will replace audio that may refer to CHARNAME's gender incorrectly, either shortening the audio or removing it entirely. Please note that even without this component installed, some female-only dialogue already has altered audio.

## Phaere Expanded
This option allows female CHARNAMEs to flirt and sleep with Phaere. Includes new reactivity from Anomen, Rasaad, and Hexxat. Adds dialogue options to Aerie's reaction that can prevent the romance from breaking. Please be aware that this component does not remove the coercive elements original to Phaere's dialogue.

## Unlock Other Romances
Provided for the sake of convenience, this component removes romance restrictions on characters who have not yet been expanded. This includes Jaheira, Aerie, Anomen, Rasaad, and Neera. Aside from a few instances here and there, their dialogue remains untouched and may refer to the player character incorrectly (e.g. pronouns).

## Compatibility
This mod was designed to work specifically with BG2:EE and may not be compatible with the original release of BG2. The mod is EET-compatible.

This mod should be compatible with other WeiDU mods. However, some mods may contradict specific elements of this mod. For example, other mods may reference a female CHARNAME as male. Compatibility patches for such instances are planned for future versions of this mod.
