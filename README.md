BG2 Romance Expanded is a work-in-progress mod that allows players to complete the canon BG2 romances regardless of gender or race. Currently, only some components of the project have been completed. For more in-depth information, see the [wiki](https://github.com/Otherwisely/BG2-Romance-Expanded/wiki).

## Viconia Romance Expanded
Allows an alternate romance path for a female CHARNAME and allows romance for CHARNAMEs of all races. Expands a few select dialogues.

## Phaere Expanded
In the unmodded game, male CHARNAMEs can flirt with and even sleep with Phaere. This option allows female CHARNAMEs to do the same. Includes new reactivity from Anomen, Rasaad, and Hexxat. Adds dialogue options to Aerie's reaction that can prevent the romance from breaking.

## Compatibility
This mod was designed to work specifically with BG2:EE.

This mod should be compatible with other WeiDU mods. However, some mods may contradict specific elements of this mod. For example, other mods may reference a female CHARNAME as male, due to Viconia's unmodded romance being locked to males. Viconia may also refer to half-elf NPCs with less-than-charitable terms even if she has promised a half-elf CHARNAME to no longer do so. Compatibility patches for such instances are planned for future versions of this mod.

The mod is currently only available in English. If you would like to translate it into another language, please reach out on the discussions page.
